This page describes the security implementation for the Ingenium Archive Service. The service utilizes a **JWT RS256 bearer-token** flow for authenticating requests and an RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) model for authorizing operations based on scopes defined in the OpenAPI specification.

## Overview of Authentication Flow

The authentication mechanism is integrated into the Express application via `swagger-tools` middleware. Every request targeting a protected endpoint must include an `Authorization` header containing a JSON Web Token (JWT).

### Data Flow Diagram: Token Validation
This diagram illustrates how a request is processed from the `Authorization` header to the final permission check.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Request Layer"
        REQ["HTTP Request"] -- "Header: Authorization: Bearer <JWT>" --> MW_META["middleware.swaggerMetadata()"]
    end

    subgraph "Security Middleware [index.js]"
        MW_META --> MW_SEC["middleware.swaggerSecurity()"]
        MW_SEC --> USER_SEC["UserSecurity Handler"]
        
        USER_SEC --> BYPASS_CHECK{"required_scopes == []?"}
        BYPASS_CHECK -- "Yes" --> GRANT["Grant Access (cb(null))"]
        
        BYPASS_CHECK -- "No" --> JWT_VERIFY["jwt.verify(token, PUBLIC_PEM)"]
        JWT_VERIFY -- "Failure" --> DENY_403["Return 403 Forbidden"]
        
        JWT_VERIFY -- "Success" --> SCOPE_EXTRACT["Extract scopes from Decoded Token"]
        SCOPE_EXTRACT --> INTERSECT{"Intersection with required_scopes?"}
        
        INTERSECT -- "Non-empty" --> GRANT
        INTERSECT -- "Empty" --> DENY_403
    end

        index_js["index.js"]

    end

    JWT_VERIFY -.-> config_js
    INTERSECT -.-> swagger_yaml

## Configuration and Public Key (RS256)

The service uses the **RS256** (RSA Signature with SHA-256) algorithm, which is an asymmetric signing algorithm. This requires a public key to verify tokens that were signed by an external Identity Provider (IdP).

- **Configuration**: The public key is loaded from the `PUBLIC_PEM` environment variable via `config.js` [config.js:12-12]().
- **Implementation**: Inside `index.js`, the `jwt.verify` function uses this `public_pem` to validate the token's signature [index.js:168-170]().

| Variable | Source | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `public_pem` | `process.env.PUBLIC_PEM` | The RSA public key in PEM format used to verify JWT signatures. |
| `algorithms` | Hardcoded `['RS256']` | The specific algorithm enforced during verification. |

## Scopes and Authorization

The service maps JWT "scopes" to API operations. These scopes are defined in the `securityDefinitions` section of the Swagger file.

### Swagger Definition
The service uses a "practical get-around" by defining the security type as `oauth2` with an `implicit` flow in the Swagger spec to enable scope-based validation within `swagger-tools`, even though the underlying transport is a standard JWT Bearer token [api/swagger.yaml:16-22]().

### Scope Extraction and Matching
1. **Extraction**: The middleware extracts the `scopes` array from the decoded JWT payload. It handles both simple string arrays and arrays of objects (e.g., `{ scope: "admin" }`) [index.js:177-179]().
2. **Intersection**: It performs a set intersection between the scopes present in the token and the `required_scopes` defined for that specific route in `swagger.yaml` [index.js:181-182]().
3. **Grant/Deny**: If the intersection is non-empty (the user has at least one required scope), access is granted via `cb(null)`. Otherwise, a `403 Forbidden` response is returned [index.js:184-189]().

### Code-to-Spec Mapping
This diagram shows how code entities in `index.js` interact with definitions in `swagger.yaml`.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "api/swagger.yaml"
        OP_POST["Operation: POST /executions"]
        REQ_SCOPES["required_scopes: ['execute:wsts', ...]"]
        OP_POST --> REQ_SCOPES
    end

    subgraph "index.js [UserSecurity]"
        FUNC_CB["UserSecurity(req, auth, required_scopes, cb)"]
        LODASH_INT["_.intersection(scope_names, required_scopes)"]
        JWT_DEC["jwt.verify()"]
    end

    REQ_SCOPES -- "Passed as Argument" --> FUNC_CB
    JWT_DEC -- "Yields scope_names" --> LODASH_INT
    REQ_SCOPES -- "Compared in" --> LODASH_INT
```

## Public Endpoints and Bypass

Certain endpoints, such as health checks, must be accessible without a valid JWT. The system implements a special bypass for these cases.

- **Mechanism**: If a route is defined in `swagger.yaml` with an empty security scope list (`[]`), the `UserSecurity` middleware skips token verification entirely [index.js:155-157]().
- **Example**: The `/health` endpoint (though truncated in provided snippets) typically utilizes this bypass to allow monitoring tools to check service status without credentials.

## Summary of Security Scopes

The following table lists key scopes defined in the system and their intended roles:

| Scope | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `admin` | Administrative permissions (venues, users). |
| `execute:*` | Permission to run procedures on specific venue types (wsts, testbed, sit, other). |
| `author` | Permission for authoring procedures. |
| `imcm` | Information Management Configuration Management (releasing procedures). |
| `basic` | Basic level permissions, such as adding comments. |
